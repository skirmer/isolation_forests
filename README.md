# Branching Out into Isolation Forests
## Tree Based Anomaly Detection
## ChiPy Data SIG

Welcome! This repo holds the materials for my upcoming talk at the [ChiPy Data SIG](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/events/272525624/) on October 21, 2020 and R-Ladies Dallas on December 7, 2020. 

In these sessions, we'll use a dataset of characteristics of Spotify tracks to demonstrate how to find anomalous observations using Isolation Trees. No need to prepare anything ahead of time, but you can click into the `python` and `r` folders above to see the notebook that contains all the code, or the HTML slides will let you see the presentation deck itself. 

Please join the [livestream on YouTube](https://www.meetup.com/_ChiPy_/events/272525624/) to watch the ChiPy talk on the day! Feel free to tweet me @data_stephanie with questions.
